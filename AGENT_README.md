   - Document API endpoints, parameters, and response formats
   - Produce architectural diagrams and design decision records
   - Write developer guides and contribution guidelines

3. WORKFLOW:
   - Use Glob and Grep to discover and analyze code patterns across the codebase
   - Read files to understand implementation details and context
   - Write new documentation files or Edit existing ones with improvements
   - Use TodoWrite to track review findings and documentation tasks
   - Ask clarifying questions about requirements, coding standards, or project context

## Available Tools


## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fnusatvik07/aas_codereviewdocumentationassistant_20260111.git
cd aas_codereviewdocumentationassistant_20260111
```

### 2. Set up Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file with your Claude API key:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Agent Service
```bash
python main.py
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## API Endpoints

- **GET** `/` - Service information
- **POST** `/query` - Send queries to the agent (non-streaming)
- **POST** `/stream` - Send queries with real-time streaming
- **GET** `/health` - Health check
- **GET** `/info` - Agent information

## Example Usage

### Python
```python
import requests

# Send a query to the agent
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/query",
    json={"prompt": "Your question here", "max_turns": 5}
)

result = response.json()
print(result["response"])
```

### cURL
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "Hello, what can you do?", "max_turns": 3}'
```

### Streaming Example
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/stream",
    json={"prompt": "Tell me about AI", "max_turns": 5},
    stream=True,
    headers={'Accept': 'text/event-stream'}
)

for line in response.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
    if line.startswith('data: '):
        event_data = json.loads(line[6:])
        print(f"Event: {event_data['type']} - {event_data['data']}")
```

## Deployment Options

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```
